# TrainScheduler

This app uses the browser's local storage and the MomentJS library to track the schedule of incoming trains. The schedule is custom created by the user by inputting the train name, starting time, and train interval. Next train time is automatically calculated using the current time and updated every minute. Train Scheduler was built with css, bootstrap, and momentJS.
